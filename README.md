## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

In this project, I finally managed to write code by myself, from start to finish. I have learned a little more about the semantics of HTML, as well as CSS concepts such as Flexbox and responsiveness.

The addition that I liked most was in the CSS, when using `position: absolute` to correctly fit the Footer in the page botttom:
```css
footer {
    position: absolute;
    bottom: 0;
    ...
}
```

### Continued development

The main concepts I need to improve and domain are CSS Flexbox, Positions and Responsiveness on smaller screens.
On the other hand, I know that HTML semantics are also crucial to the code and definitely need improvement as well.

### Useful resources

- [W3Schools](https://www.w3schools.com/) - This helped me with the correct use of CSS Flexbox.
- [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) - This helped me with some doubts about semantic tags in HTML.
